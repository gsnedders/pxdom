    pxdom 1.3 <br />
    A Python DOM implementation

  <p id="nav">
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR#dom3"><span>W3C DOM specs</span></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    pxdom is a W3C DOM Level 3 implementation for XML 1.0/1.1 with/without
    namespaces, using Python and OMG-style (_get/_set) bindings. All features
    described in the Core and LS Recommendations are supported, with the
    following exceptions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> validation; </li>
    <li> asynchronous LSParsers; </li>
    <li> name character checking is only completely rigorous for XML 1.1. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    pxdom runs on Python 1.5.2 or later, but certain features are dependent on Python version:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> for Unicode, Python 1.6 or later is required; </li>
    <li> using a LSSerializer to write to an HTTP URI requires Python 2.0 or later; </li>
    <li> Unicode character normalisation options require Python 2.3 or later. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Installation </h2>
  <p>
    Copy pxdom.py into any folder in your Python path, for example
    /usr/lib/python/site-packages or C:\Python23\Lib\site-packages.
    Pre-compile bytecode version with &#8216;import pxdom&#8217;
    if necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    pxdom can also be included and imported as a submodule of another package.
    This is a good strategy if you wish to distribute a DOM-based application without
    having to worry about the versions of Python and/or PyXML installed on users&#8217
    machines; the only dependencies are the standard library string-handling and
    URL-related modules.
  </p>

  <h2> Usage </h2>
  <p>
    The pxdom module implements the DOMImplementationSource interface
    from DOM Level 3 Core. So to parse a document from a file, use eg.:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code"><div><code class="py">
    import pxdom <br />
    dom= pxdom.getDOMImplementation('') <br />
    parser= dom.createLSParser(dom.MODE_SYNCHRONOUS, None) <br />
    doc= parser.parseURI('file:///f|/data/doc.xml')
  </code></div></blockquote>
  <p>
    For more on using DOM Level 3 Load features to create documents from various
    sources, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-LS"><span>DOM Level
    3 LS</span></a> specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, the pxdom module offers the convenience functions
    <code class="py">parse</code> and <code class="py">parseString</code>,
    which work like the Python minidom module&#8217;s functions of the same names:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code"><div><code class="py">
    doc= pxdom.parse('F:\\data\\doc.xml') <br />
    doc= pxdom.parseString('&lt;el attr="val">content&lt;/el>')
  </code></div></blockquote>

  <h3> DOMConfiguration parameters </h3>
  <p>
    The result of the parse operation depends on the parameters set on the <code class="py">LSParser.domConfig</code>
    mapping. By default, in accordance with the DOM specification, all CDATA sections will be
    replaced with plain text nodes and all bound entity references will be replaced by the
    contents of the entity referred to. This includes external entity references and the external
    subset.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use the <code class="py">parse</code> and <code class="py">parseString</code> functions,
    pxdom will set the parameter &#8216;cdata-sections&#8217; to <code class="py">True</code>,
    allowing CDATA sections to stay in the document, and the parameter &#8216;pxdom-resolve-resources&#8217;
    to <code class="py">False</code> so external entities and the external subset are left alone.
    This is to emulate the behaviour of the Python standard library&#8217;s minidom module.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you prefer also to receive <code class="py">EntityReference</code>  nodes in your document,
    set the &#8216;entities&#8217; parameter to a true value. For example:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code"><div><code class="py">
    parser= dom.createLSParser(dom.MODE_SYNCHRONOUS, None) <br />
    parser.domConfig.setParameter('cdata-sections', 1) <br />
    parser.domConfig.setParameter('entities', 1) <br />
    doc= parser.parseURI('file:///home/data/doc.xml')
  </code></div></blockquote>
  <p>
    Or, using the <code class="py">parse</code>/<code class="py">parseString</code>
    shortcut functions, you can pass in an optional dictionary of extra DOMConfiguration
    parameters to set, like:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code"><div><code class="py">
    doc= pxdom.parse('file:///home/data/doc.xml', {'entities': 1})
  </code></div></blockquote>
  <p>
    (Of course, this usage would no longer be minidom-compatible.)
    See the DOM 3 Core and LS specifications for more
    <code class="py">DOMConfiguration</code> parameters.
  </p>

  <h2> Extensions </h2>
  <p>
    pxdom supports some supplemental non-standard features.
    Their names are always prefixed with &#8216;pxdom&#8217; to
    avoid confusion with the standard.
  </p>

  <h3> Extra DOMConfiguration parameters </h3>
  <p>
    Configuration parameters in DOM Level 3 may affect parsing, serialisation
    and normalisation operations. pxdom adds a few new parameters not defined
    in the specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to set a pxdom extra parameter to a non-default value but still be
    compatible with any other DOM Level 3 implementation, you can use the
    <code class="py">DOMConfiguration.canSetParameter</code> method
    to ensure that the parameter is supported first.
  </p>

  <h4> pxdom-resolve-resources </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: parsing. Default: True (except with
    <code class="py">parse</code>/<code class="py">parseString</code> functions).
  </p>
  <p>
    Dictates whether resources external to the document file will be
    resolved and used. This affects external entities and the DTD external subset.
  </p>
  <p>
    pxdom uses only the SYSTEM identifier in fetching an external resource, so
    parsing an XHTML document, for example, would make many requests to the
    W3C server to grab the document type information. This is quite slow. Note
    also that at the time of writing the DTD referenced by XHTML 1.1 documents
    has acknowledged bugs in it, which pxdom is unable to parse. (This has been
    corrected for the forthcoming XHTML Modularization Second Edition specification.)
  </p>
  <p>
    To do something with PUBLIC identifiers, such as supply local copies of DTDs,
    you would have to provide a standard DOM <code class="py">LSResourceResolver</code>
    object to the configuration parameter &#8216;resource-resolver&#8217;. Resource
    resolvers will never be called if &#8216;pxdom-resolve-resources&#8217; is set to false.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the convenience functions <code class="py">parse</code>
    and <code class="py">parseString</code> are called,
    &#8216;pxdom-resolve-resources&#8217; will be false by default, instead of true,
    for minidom compatibility.
  </p>

  <h4> pxdom-normalize-text </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: normalisation. Default: True.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dictates whether text node normalisation (as performed by  the DOM Level 1
    Core <code class="py">Node.normalize</code> method) will take place when the DOM Level 3 Core
    <code class="py">Document.normalizeDocument</code> method is called.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, matching the DOM specification, text node normalisation does
    occur, but pxdom allows this to be turned off if unwanted.
  </p>

  <h4> pxdom-update-entities </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: normalisation. Default: True.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dictates whether entity reference nodes have their content child nodes
    updated from the declaration stored in the doctype. This may result in
    descendants with different namespaces when the entity reference has been
    moved, if the entity contains prefixes whose namespaces are not declared in
    the entity.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, matching the DOM specification, entities are updated,
    but pxdom allows this to be turned off if unwanted.
  </p>

  <h4> pxdom-reset-identity </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: normalisation. Default: True.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dictates whether attributes should have their user-specified-IDness (as
    set by the setAttributeId etc. methods) reset to false during document
    normalisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, matching the DOM specification, this does occur,
    but pxdom allows this to be turned off if unwanted.
  </p>

  <h4> pxdom-preserve-base-uri </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: parsing, normalisation, serialisation. Default: True.
  </p>
  <p>
    When enabled, pxdom attempts to preserve the base URI context whenever
    a node that changes base URI is replaced by its contents. This can happen when
    an element with an <code class="xml">xml:base</code> attribute is SKIPped
    by a DOM 3 LS filter, or when an entity reference with a different base URI to its
    parent is flattened.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, matching the DOM specification, base URIs are preserved. However,
    the extra <code class="xml">xml:base</code> attributes added to child elements
    may be unwanted if you are working with entities (especially external entities)
    but do not wish to use XML Base, so pxdom allows it to be turned off. If
    you do so, the DOMError warning &#8216;pi-base-uri-lost&#8217; will also not be
    generated.
  </p>

  <h4> pxdom-assume-element-content </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: parsing, normalisation, serialisation, isElementContentWhitespace.
    Default: False.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to support the feature <code class="py">Text.isElementContentWhitespace</code>,
    pxdom must know the content model of the particular element that contains the text node. Often this is
    only defined in the DTD external subset, which might have been omitted or not read.
  </p>
  <p>
    Normally, following the XML Information Set specification, pxdom will guess that elements with unknown
    content models do not contain &#8216;element content&#8217; &#8212; so
    <code class="py">Text.isElementContentWhitespace</code> will always return
    <code class="py">False</code> for elements not mentioned in the DOCTYPE internal subset.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if the DOMConfiguration parameter &#8216;pxdom-assume-element-content&#8217;
    is True, it will guess that unknown elements <em>do</em> contain element content,
    and so whitespace nodes inside them <em>will</em> be &#8216;element content whitespace&#8217;
    (often referred to as &#8216;ignorable whitespace&#8217;).
  </p>
  <p>
    This parameter can be combined with the &#8216;element-content-whitespace&#8217; parameter
    to parse an XML file and return a DOM tree containing no superfluous whitespace nodes whatsoever,
    which can make subsequent processing much simpler:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code"><div><code class="py">
    parser= dom.createLSParser(dom.MODE_SYNCHRONOUS, None) <br />
    parser.domConfig.setParameter('element-content-whitespace', 0) <br />
    parser.domConfig.setParameter('pxdom-assume-element-content', 1) <br />
    doc= parser.parse('file:///data/foo.xml')
  </code></div></blockquote>

  <h4> pxdom-html-compatible </h4>
  <p>
    Applies to: serialisation. Default: False.
  </p>
  <p>
    Optionally ensures serialisation operations return markup that is as far as possible compatible
    with legacy HTML parsers. In particular, satisfies XHTML 1.0&#8217;s HTML compatibility
    guidelines C.2, C.3 and C.10.
  </p>

  <h3> Extra object properties </h3>
  <h4> Node.pxdomLocation </h4>
  <p>
    Read-only property giving a DOM Level 3 DOMLocator object for any Node.
    If the Node was created by a parsing operation this will reveal the file and
    row/column number in which the node was found - particularly useful for
    error-reporting purposes.
  </p>

  <h4> Node.pxdomContent </h4>
  <p>
    A convenience property to get the markup for a node, or replace the node
    with alternative parsed markup, without having to create a separate
    <code class="py">LSSerializer</code> or <code class="py">LSParser</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All nodes have a readable <code class="py">pxdomContent</code>, but only those at content level are
    writable (attribute nodes, for instance, are not). The document&#8217;s <code class="py">domConfig</code>
    is used to give parameters for parse and serialise operations invoked by <code class="py">pxdomContent</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="py">pxdomContent</code> is an extended replacement for the
    <code class="py">ElementLS.markupContent</code> property that was in earlier
    Working Drafts of the DOM 3 LS spec.
  </p>

  <h4> Entity.pxdomAvailable </h4>
  <p>
    A flag indicating whether the entity&#8217;s replacement content is
    available in the <code class="py">childNodes</code> property. Internal
    entities are always available; unparsed external entities never are; for
    parsed external entities it depends on whether external resources were
    resolved at parse-time.
  </p>

  <h4> Entity.pxdomDocumentURI </h4>
  <p>
    On external entities, gives the actual URI the entity was read from, after
    applying the systemId to the baseURI and going through any LSResourceResolver
    redirection. For internal and unavailable entities this property is null.
  </p>

  <h4> DocumentType.pxdomElements/Attlists </h4>
  <p>
    In addition to <code class="py">entities</code> and <code class="py">notations</code>,
    pxdom includes <code class="py">NamedNodeMap</code>s in the
    <code class="py">DocumentType</code> for the other
    two types of declaration that might occur in the DTD. They can be read to get more
    information on content models than the DOM Level 3 <code class="py">TypeInfo</code>
    interface makes available.
  </p>

  <h3> Extra pxdom node types </h3>
  <h4> ElementDeclaration </h4>
  <p>
    <code class="py">ElementDeclaration</code>s can be obtained from the
    <code class="py">DocumentType.pxdomElements</code> map. Its
    <code class="py">nodeName</code> is the element name given in the
    corresponding DTD <code class="xml">&lt;!ELEMENT></code>
    declaration).
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="py">ElementDeclaration</code> nodes have an integer
    <code class="py">contentType</code> property with enum keys
    <code class="py">EMPTY_CONTENT</code>, <code class="py">ANY_CONTENT</code>,
    <code class="py">MIXED_CONTENT</code> and <code class="py">ELEMENT_CONTENT</code>.
    In the case of mixed and element content, the <code class="py">elements</code> property
    gives more information on the child elements allowed.
  </p>

  <h4> AttributeDeclarationList </h4>
  <p>
    <code class="py">AttributeDeclarationList</code>s can be obtained from the
    <code class="py">DocumentType.pxdomAttlists</code> map. Its
    nodeName is the name of the element whose attributes it is defining, as
    given in the <code class="xml">&lt;!ATTLIST></code> declaration).
  </p>
  <p>
    <code class="py">AttributeListDeclaration</code>s hold a
    <code class="py">NamedNodeMap</code> in their <code class="py">declarations</code>
    property, mapping attribute names from the declaration to corresponding
    <code class="py">AttributeDeclaration</code> nodes.
  </p>

  <h4> AttributeDeclaration </h4>
  <p>
    <code class="py">AttributeDeclaration</code> nodes have an integer
    <code class="py">attributeType</code> property with enum keys <code class="py">ID_ATTR</code>,
    <code class="py">IDREF_ATTR</code>, <code class="py">IDREFS_ATTR</code>,
    <code class="py">ENTITY_ATTR</code>, <code class="py">ENTITIES_ATTR</code>,
    <code class="py">NMTOKEN_ATTR</code>, <code class="py">NMTOKENS_ATTR</code>,
    <code class="py">NOTATION_ATTR</code>, <code class="py">CDATA_ATTR</code> and
    <code class="py">ENUMERATION_ATTR</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of enumeration and notation attribute types, the <code class="py">typeValues</code>
    property holds a list of possible string values. There is also an integer <code class="py">defaultType</code>
    property with enum keys <code class="py">REQUIRED_VALUE</code>,<code class="py"> IMPLIED_VALUE</code>,
    <code class="py">DEFAULT_VALUE</code> and <code class="py">FIXED_VALUE</code>.
    In the case of fixed and defaulting attributes, the <code class="py">childNodes</code>
    property holds any text and/or entity reference nodes that make up the default value.
  </p>

  <h2 id="changes"> Changelog </h2>
  <h3> Updates from 1.2 to 1.3 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added DOMConfiguration parameter pxdom-html-compatible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Made the (implementation-defined in spec) Document.cloneNode() do the most
      likely-useful action, namely creating a new Document (and copying child content
      with new ownerDocument if it is a deep clone).
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed bug that disallowed resetting of NamedNodeNS prefixes to None.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added specific checks in child-altering methods (appendChild et al) so that they raise
      an error when a disallowed null is passed instead of letting the operation silently
      do nothing. Changed order of checks in creating NS-aware nodes so that a more
      helpful error results from illegal characters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Various alterations to parser and serialiser handling of narrow strings. Try where
      possible to coerce string to unicode, resulting in more consistent results with
      unusual character encodings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Parser: fixed bug disallowing DOCTYPE declaration with no publicId, systemId,
      internal subset or whitespace. Fixed possible denormalised text parsing in entities.
      Fixed possible parameter entity edge cases (spec is woolly here). Use sets where
      available (Python 2.3+) for marginal performance improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serialiser: ensured newLine property was consistently used throughout the
      document. Encoded NEL and Unicode Line Separator characters as character references.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Updates from 1.1 to 1.2 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Redid entity reference parse/normalise/serialise operations, hopefully resulting in more
      consistent results in the face of combinations of text node normalisation, NodeFilter SKIPping
      and baseURI loss.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed typo in OutputBuffer causing NameError to be raised instead of UnsupportedEncodingErr
      with DOMError handling, if an unknown encoding is used (thanks to: Andrew Johnson)
    </li>
    <li>
      Added pxdom-preserve-base-uri parameter to control the baseURI preservation that now
      also works with element skipping and normalisation. xml:base attributes are now added as
      non-specified Attrs, similar to default attributes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Redid node name character handling to cope more gracefully with narrow strings and
      apply the XML 1.1 restrictions on what Unicode characters can be in a node name.
      (The additional restrictions of XML 1.0 are not enforced, largely because its character
      model is an insanity). Updated parsing and serialisation of character references to
      cope with characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane in &#8216;narrow&#8217;
      (UTF-16) Python builds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optimised away an order-N-squared method in LSParser, resulting in
      faster &#8212; though still slow, obv. &#8212; parse times for long documents (eg. 10x
      speedup for the commonly-used test file ot.xml). (Hat tip: Frederik Lundh.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Changed isID property to conform to new interpretation of spec: reading Attr.isID
      returns True if the attribute has schema-determined-IDness <em>or</em>
      user-determined-IDness, but setting it (through the setAttributeId etc. methods) only affects the
      user-determined-IDness; xml:id is interpreted as part of
      schema-determined-IDness. Added new configuration parameter
      pxdom-reset-identity to allow the removal of user-determined IDness on
      normalisation to be disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed namespace undeclarations (<code class="xml">xmlns:something=""</code>)
      causing namespaceURIs to become empty strings instead of unbound/null at parse-time.
      Fixed namespace fixup to stop extra redundant declarations being added.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed stupid DTD-parsing bugs that crept into 1.1 before release without tripping the
      Test Suite. When pxdom-resolve-resources was False, external general entities could
      cause errors, and INCLUDE sections were broken.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added trivial repr functions so Nodes are easier to read.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Updates from 1.0 to 1.1 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Entity parsing rewritten to include external entity/subset support, full checking for
      parameter entities in the external subset, catching of circular references and fixing
      treatment of character references in replacement text. Also ensured serialisation
      and normalisation with &#8216;entities&#8217; only use replacement content
      for entities that are bound and available. Added &#8216;pxdom-update-entities&#8217;
      parameter to disable normalizeDocument entity behaviour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Namespace lookup and handling at parse, serialise and normalisation phases redone to ensure
      namespaces are correct even when content is filtered out (and also improve parse speed marginally).
      Following Recommendation, the public lookup methods made ignorant about built-in
      namespaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      Made parser use the &#8216;namespaces&#8217; parameter to decide
      whether to create Level 1 or Level 2 nodes. Added exceptions and DOMErrors
      for parsing namespace-ill-formed names or normalising/serialising Level 1 nodes
      at Level 2. (The previous parsing fall-back-to-Level-1 behaviour is now available
      by using a DOMErrorHandler that asks to continue parsing.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated DOMException, LSException and DOMError into the same class
      to avoid having to use an extra level of exception wrapping. Made
      normalizeDocument not throw exceptions connected to fatal DOMErrors
      (unlike LSParser and LSSerializer). Disallowed XML 1.1 output
      without doctype.
    </li>
    <li>
      Following change in final Recommendation, made setting &#8217;entities&#8217;
      to false no longer remove the entities map in the doctype, and renamed DOMError
      &#8216;cdata-section-splitted&#8217; to &#8216;cdata-sections-splitted&#8217;.
      Made CDATA splitting use Tim Bray&#8217;s suggested method from the Annotated
      XML specification, instead of creating an unnecessary Text node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed possible spurious exceptions in Node.getFeature and normalizeDocument with
      check-character-normalization failure, namespace declaration removal and entity removal.
      Made Node.normalize respect &#8216;normalize-characters&#8217;, but not
      &#8216;check-character-normalization&#8217;, following Recommendation.
      Add &#8216;pxdom-normalize-text&#8217; parameter to disable Level 1-style
      text node normalisation in normalizeDocument.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added typeInfo.isDerivedFrom method and fixed DERIVED constants following Recommendation
      (though this is not relevant to a non-schema-validating implementation like pxdom).
    </li>
    <li>
      Serialization now doesn&#8217;t escape tabs in non-Attr text content, and doesn&#8217;t
      allow Attr children to be filtered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Catch case of trying to renameNode to empty string, and trying to use renameNode to
      make a Level 1 node with non-null namespaceURI. Return the correct type of error on
      attempt to rename a document.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed insertBefore/replaceChild used with the same node for both parameters
      following discussion on www-dom list, to do the sensible-but-not-required thing
      instead of throwing an embarrassingly inaccurate exception.
    </li>
    <li>
      Made reading a file with invalid byte sequences fall back to replacement instead of
      raising UnicodeDecodeError. This should make reading non-Unicode files easier.
    </li>
    <li>
      Redid baseURI to return null for the things the infoset mapping says should be null,
      and return the right answer for the new external entities. Made parsing without entities
      add xml:base attributes to elements whose Entity baseURIs are different from the parent,
      supporting pi-base-not-preserved DOMError too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Following resolution on www-dom list, no longer use Text nodes to represent
      white space at the Document level. Instead act as if there is always one newline
      character between each Document child node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Made writing to pxdomContent replace the node, rather than its children, as it
      should have been all along.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed bug where comments are parsed as text when disabled from the configuration.
      (Yikes! How did the Test Suite miss that one?)
    </li>
    <li>
      Added support for xml:id attributes. XML ID is currently only a Working Draft but it seems
      so obviously useful it should make it through standardisation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Updates from 0.9 to 1.0 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Tracking changes in the new DOM 3 Proposed Recommendations, renamed LS config properties, added
      LSException, changed default newLine behaviour, removed prefix from previously-non-standard
      pxdom-no-input-specified parameter, allow LS namespace parameters to be set False, changed
      output filter call order
    </li>
    <li> Added support for DOMConfiguration parameters &#8216;format-pretty-print&#8217; and &#8216;supported-media-types-only&#8217; </li>
    <li> Following discussion on www-dom list, changed encoding-to-string to use the string&#8217;s native encoding, unless overridden by output.encoding </li>
    <li> Added extra error checks for cases in the L3 DOM Test Suite </li>
    <li> Fixed recursive readonlyness of entities, notations, entity references </li>
    <li> Fixed setting textContent on non-Text-containing nodes </li>
    <li> Fixed very silly canSetParameter bug causing occasional erroneous return-false </li>
    <li> Added compareDocumentPosition to public interface, and fixed fault in comparison of non-child nodes </li>
    <li> Renamed parameterNameList parameterNames and made it return a proper DOM-style List object instead of a Python one </li>
    <li> Made namespace/prefix lookup results match the reference algorithm more closely </li>
    <li> Reorganised parse/serialisation, allowing application-side LSInput and LSOutput objects to be used </li>
    <li> Made isEntityContentWhitespace cope with nodes inside entity references </li>
    <li> Fixed possibly-incorrect namespaceURI of unprefixed default attributes </li>
    <li> Fixed baseURI for entity references and doctype </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Updates from 0.8 to 0.9 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Lots of interface alterations and renamings to track changes in the new DOM 3 Candidate Recommendations. </li>
    <li> Node.pxdomContent replaces ElementLS.markupContent (removed from CR). Other old DocumentLS, ElementLS interfaces removed. </li>
    <li> Module code rearranged into separate aspects to cut down on some of the &#8216;monster-class&#8217; readability problems. </li>
    <li> Serialisation mostly rewritten to conform better to specification, particularly the escaping of characters that can't be reproduced in the current encoding. </li>
    <li> Normalisation partially rewritten, support for Unicode character normalisation added. </li>
    <li> Support for DOMConfiguration parameter &#8216;canonical-form&#8217;. </li>
    <li> Parameter pxdom-resolve-resources added as placeholder for future external entity support .</li>
    <li> Made PIs with no data part parse and serialise correctly. </li>
    <li> Many changes to LSFilters, which were a bit broken. </li>
    <li> Allow multiple attributes with the same namespaceURI and localName (but different prefix) to be parsed. (For support of non-namespace-well-formed docs that use attribute names with colons, and unbound namespaces in entities.) </li>
    <li> Renamed DocumentType.elements and .attlists to pxdom-prefixed versions, as they are non-standard extensions. </li>
    <li> Fixed parsing of &lt;!ATTLIST>s with NMTOKENS, IDREF, IDREFS (whoops!). </li>
    <li> Made attribute value normalization happen in more places it should and fixed entref/charref whitespace-char replacement issues. </li>
    <li> Fixed normalizeDocument namespace-declarations=false option. </li>
    <li> Support for &#8216;well-formed&#8217; parameter, tightened up invalid character checks at DOM level too. </li>
    <li> Made splitTexting a CDATASection correctly create a new CDATASection node, not text. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Updates from 0.7 to 0.8 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Tracking forthcoming changes to spec, getDOMImplementations renamed getDOMImplementationList, isWhitespaceInElementContext method becomes isElementContentWhitespace property, isId method becomes property, DOMLocator.offset becomes byteOffset/utf16Offset (non-functional). </li>
    <li> Don&#8217;t claim to support DOM Core 1.0 &#8212; following discussion on www-dom-ts, there is no such feature. </li>
    <li> Allow getDOMImplementation[List] to be called with no argument, as a shortcut. </li>
    <li> Allow empty string to be passed in to namespaceURI arguments, meaning same as None. </li>
    <li> Added NODE_ADOPTED UserDataHandler event, compliance fixes to AdoptNode (ents, default attrs). </li>
    <li> Added DOMConfig.parameterNameList. </li>
    <li> Added minidom-style NamedNodeMap dictionary accessors for compatibility (thanks to: Paul Boddie). </li>
    <li> Implemented element-content-whitespace option, added pxdom-assume-element-content to make it more useful. </li>
    <li> Refuse to parse invalid &lt; in attribute values (makes finding well-formedness errors easier). </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Updates from 0.6 to 0.7 </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Tracking forthcoming changes to spec, DOMSerialiser.writeURI renamed to writeToURI. </li>
    <li> Fix typos in Document.isDefaultNamespace and Text.replaceWholeText raising exceptions (oops). </li>
    <li> Made renameNode and writes to Node.prefix update NodeListByTagName objects correctly. </li>
    <li> Made ParseError return non-Unicode string for easier debugging. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Future work </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Consider supporting DOM Level 3 Events and/or Level 2 Traversal/Range
      (any interest for these?);
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider non-monolithic package distribution option: pxdom being a single
      module is convenient for distribution but it is getting <em>big</em>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additional thanks to all responsible for the DOM Test Suite (which has caught
    many gotchas in previous pxdom versions, regardless of the bugs I keep filing
    against it), particularly Curt Arnold (for fixing many of them).
